This mod that enables custom game speeds for the game Farthest Frontier.
Mod version: v1
Tested with: v0.9.0
Disclaimer
This is alpha software, as such it might be unstable and cause issues. This is also my very first mod for this game and the first time I'm using Melon Loader.
Finally, I know that modding a game in early access in not that smart but it was fun nonetheless.

Features
Unlocks game speeds 5x and 10x which are already in-game but disabled
Adds more custom game speeds:
15x
20x
30x
50x - warning: this will drop a lot of frames and probably melt your cpu :)
Speed game's color in the UI will change based on the selected speed

Setup
Install and configure Melon Loader
You can follow Step 2 on this guide
Download the dll from releases page and place it under game folder/Mods
Start the game
Melon Loader's console will start too. This will contain useful debug messages so keep an eye on it in case of errors.

Usage
Use the increase/decrease speed buttons in the UI or use any of the new hotkeys:
5 - 5x speed
6 - 10x speed
7 - 15x speed
8 - 20x speed
9 - 30x speed
0 - 50x speed

TODO
A better readme
Mod initialization once the game loads and not in the main loop
